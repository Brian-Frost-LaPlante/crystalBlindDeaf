might want return from goldenrod on sundays 5th floor w high friendship
lvl35 kadabra can oneshot miltank

level in daycare to 15, evolve by switch training, level to 35 in daycare

at end of part 3: kad is lvl49, statxp = [8639, 10019, 9310, 9275, 9275, 10791].

if i get thunder punch, lvl 52 kad can one-shot exec4 houndoom after an x special
need to worry about first houndour's roar though, so deposit all pokes first.

clair gets whacked by psychic at lvl 52 kad w/ x special. need prz berry


Before E4, there are 7 rare candies, many trainers still around to battle.
Will 
	- fire and thunder punch one-shot all 
	- need to worry about quick attacks (jk they cant touch me, just potion afterwards)
Koga 
	- fire punch and psych one-shot all
	- must account for protect
Bruno 
	- psychic one-shots everything
	- must worry about quick attack, detect and mach punch (jk they cant touch me just heal after)
Karen 
	- can one-shot vileplume and gengar w psychic
	- can one-shot murkrow w thunder punch or ice punch
	- umbreon and houndoom are huge issues... have to think harder.
		- a machoke at level 56 with max proteins could 1-shot both w vital throw
		- LVL 42 mac and 62 Kad could tag team umbreon (mac would need bitter berry)
		- LVL 68 Kad with burner Poke could also handle umbreon just fine
		- a machoke at level 67 with max proteins could 1-shot umbreon. 1 carbos to outspeed
		- LVL 40 Sui with 25600 spec and HP could two-shot houndoom, or tag team with kad. Have to find a silly way to account for roar here
	Probable best strat: catch suicune, ensure LVL 68 Kadabra
Lance 
	- ice punch at lvl 54 one-shots all three dragonites.
	- thunder punch will one-shot gyarados
	- at 62, thunder punch one-shots charizard, aerodactyl. 



RED
	- LVL 76 Kad with 25600 SPEC Statxp can one-shot Venusaur with psychic (and outspeeds)
	- LVL 76 Kad with 25600 SPEC Statxp can two-shot Blastoise with tpunch
	- Even LVL 100 Kad would not one-shot Blastoise! 
		- could do ice berry so I can rely on two-shotting (He outspeeds)
		- With X SPEC LVL 86 Kad could one-shot with tpunch. 
			- To set up on Pika requires par berry, could just barely survive one thunderso no way it could dal with thunder -> quick attack	
		- Without X Spec, LVL 80 Jolteon could one-shot with tbolt
		
	- even at lvl 55, Tyranitar could 1-shot Pikachu (does not outspeed)
	- at lvl 85 could one-shot espeon (does not outspeed)
	- at lvl 60 with 25600 SPEC statxp, could two-shot espeon. (does not outspeed)
	- at 65, could two-shot charizard with tbolt (does not outspeed)

	- Snorlax is really hard...

	Probable best strat: Level 76 Kad, Level 65 (or higher) Tyranitar, several burner pokemon for reflect/possible status conditions
	Another strat: crazy Kadabra setup against Espeon. involves stalling out espeon's moves with useless items
