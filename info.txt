might want return from goldenrod on sundays 5th floor w high friendship
lvl35 kadabra can oneshot miltank

level in daycare to 15, evolve by switch training, level to 35 in daycare

at end of part 3: kad is lvl49, statxp = [8639, 10019, 9310, 9275, 9275, 10791].

if i get thunder punch, lvl 52 kad can one-shot exec4 houndoom after an x special
need to worry about first houndour's roar though, so deposit all pokes first.

clair gets whacked by psychic at lvl 52 kad w/ x special. need prz berry


Before E4, there are 7 rare candies, many trainers still around to battle.
Will 
	- fire and thunder punch one-shot all 
	- need to worry about quick attacks (jk they cant touch me, just potion afterwards)
Koga 
	- fire punch and psych one-shot all
	- must account for protect
Bruno 
	- psychic one-shots everything
	- must worry about quick attack, detect and mach punch (jk they cant touch me just heal after)
Karen 
	- can one-shot vileplume and gengar w psychic
	- can one-shot murkrow w thunder punch or ice punch
	- umbreon and houndoom are huge issues... have to think harder.
		- a machoke at level 56 with max proteins could 1-shot both w vital throw
		- LVL 42 mac and 62 Kad could tag team umbreon (mac would need bitter berry)
		- LVL 68 Kad with burner Poke could also handle umbreon just fine
		- a machoke at level 67 with max proteins could 1-shot umbreon. 1 carbos to outspeed
		- LVL 40 Sui with 25600 spec and HP could two-shot houndoom, or tag team with kad. Have to find a silly way to account for roar here
	Probable best strat: catch suicune, ensure LVL 68 Kadabra
Lance 
	- ice punch at lvl 54 one-shots all three dragonites.
	- thunder punch will one-shot gyarados
	- at 62, thunder punch one-shots charizard, aerodactyl. 

----------------------------------------------------------------
Surge   -- Everything dies to Fire Punch or Psychic
Erika   -- Everything dies to Fire Punch
Sabrina -- Guard Spec + 1 X Spec + Hyper Pot  on Espeon guarantees one-shot on all with thunder punch
	- need LVL 72 for the first trainer's Hypno! eek! good thing i can do things in any order i want in this part.
Misty   -- Everything dies to Thunder Punch
Janine  -- Psychic or Fire Punch one-shots everyone
Brock   -- Psychic one-shots everything, even at level 65.
Blaine  -- Psychic one-shots everything, even at Level 65.
Blue    -- will require thought. can't set up on pidgeot because pidgeot has quick attack and does a ton of damage. Alakazam has Disable.
	- can one-shot Pidgeot with thunder punch or ice punch at level 67
	- can one-shot Rhydon with Psychic at level 67
	- can one-shot Gyarados with thunder punch at level 67
	- can one-shot Exeggutor with fire punch at level 68
	- can one-shot Arcanine with psychic at 77. need 4854 EXP after sabrina's gym before fighting blue	
	- Alakazam? At LVL 76 with an X Spec can one-shot. Can 2-shot at pretty much any level but need to deal with disable and recover.
	Need a burner Pokemon to heal kadabra in case pidgeot uses quick attack + Arcanine uses extremespeed

RED

I will be LVL 77 min here. Can use 10 rare candies to hit min 87

PIKA
-- can one-shot with psychic
-- he can QA, which does max 60 at LVL 87

ESPEON, want to set up here
-- REFLECT, I don't care about this at all
-- MUD SLAP, can lower Acc
-- PSYCHIC,  
-- SWIFT,    
At LVL 87, none of these moves can two-shot me. 
Moreover, none of these moves kills on top of the 60 damage from QA

If I GUARD SPEC turn 1, Mud slap doesnt lower acc anymore
GUARD SPEC + Heal + XSPEC + HEAL + XSPEC + XSPEC + HEAL kills, leaves me with x2.5 SPEC

I outspeed every other pokemon. It's a snoozefest easy win with 3 XSpec
